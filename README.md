## About MEGADocker - a brief history of a detonated Myrtlewood in a dirty marsh, magic, and a Mad Doctor

Once upon a time, there was a doctor (of sorts). He was probably more of an engineer than a doctor (per se), but he would argue that the line between those things was much finer than people tended to acknowledge, and besides there was no good abbreviation for Engineer. He was definitely a bit insane then, and moreso by the end of this story, and so we will refer to him as The Mad Doctor.

Many, many, moons ago, The Mad Doctor was mildly deranged and mostly destitute. One day (maybe a dreary Monday) as he sat in his domicile while munching on his delightful yet meager meal and debating the merits of the methodology he used to manage his money, The Mad Doctor noticed a miniscule Mote of detritus merrily dancing in the misty dew. He decided to move more close to the dust, so that he might determine what it might be made from, and what it may want to do, but it made a seemingly determined effort to escape him. He chased after it for months, but always it seemed to dodge his machinations at the last moment. Eventually, The Mad Doctor decided to make a devious machine to catch the little Mote. He molded some mud and mashed mints into a mug to make a device that could catch the Mote in it's muck, and with a mischevious (but not malicious) grin, he set off to finally detain the dust that had deliriously bedeviled his mind.

With his determined disposition and his mug of mud, he made haste to the darkened marsh where he last saw his prey. But his muddled mind had been marred by the deceptive little Mote, and in his mental disaarray he forgot where he had last detected the Mote. For many more months, he meandered despondently, until one morning he met the Mote in the marsh. He climbed over a mossy dead maple and suddenly made note of the Mote, glowing mysteriously. The Mote drifted lazily through the marsh that morning, dipping and descending between the mildewed dogwoods.

The Mad Doctor deployed his mint-mud mug in the darkness that day, and waited for the Mote. He monitored the Mote's movements, and just when he thought the Mote might not like mint, the Mote dove into the mug. The Mad Doctor mounted the mug to mock the Mote, but just as he peered into it's depths, the Mote floated through the side of the mug, mindless of both mud and mint, dodging into the darkness.

The Mad Doctor was distraught. Matter didn't do this, The Mad Doctor's mind declared. "Maybe the Mote is Magic", The Mad Doctor muttered to himself, and just then the Mote detonated, destroying the mighty Myrtlewood it was ducked behind. The Myrtlewood rained down into the marsh, with not even a dent to The Mad Doctor's hat (which he had made of tin-foil, naturally). He looked around, amazed that the destruction had defintely missed him by about a meter.

As The Mad Doctor watched a piece of the Myrtlewood debris disappear into the murky marsh, he noticed a tiny modicum of the Mote (let's call it a Mite) drifting out of the muck, then another, and another. But before he could catch them, they diffused into remnants of the Myrtlewood, which then started to migrate towards The Mad Doctor menacingly.

The Mad Doctor was mortified; he decided this Myrtlewood would be his doom, and so he departed. He made a break for his home - a mad dash through the dartk and dreary marsh - but momentarily, he was run down. The Myrtlewood fragments surrounded The Mad Doctor, and he knew in that moment that his days were done. Dejected, disgraced, defeated by a Mote of magic dust, The Mad Doctor accepted his demise.

Despondent, The Mad Doctor dropped his head, his mind racing with depictions of his murderous death. The Mites, (now recognizable as miniature miniature Motes) drew closer, but did not dispatch him. Indeed, the Mites dispersed from his immediate milieu and deigned to detail a dimly-lit path over drier parts of the dark and dreary marsh, dancing (more-or-less) towards his definite destination. The Mad Doctor, now delighted (if you'll excuse the pun), made his way along the makeshift map, daintily dabbing at the mud and finding the path that the no longer menacing Mites drew out to be dry.

As The Mad Doctor made his way back home, the Mites milled about, dragging a trail behind the Mad Doctor like a marriage-day dress made of moonlight. This delighted The Mad Doctor, and by the time he made it to his door, he knew that he would miss the Mites if they were to depart. The Mad Doctor, after all, had been lonely in his modest little workshop. He opened his door, and turned around, hoping that the Mites hadn't merely been another of his occasional mental daydreams, and to The Mad Doctor's surprise the Mites had delayed. For an awkward moment the Mites and The Mad Doctor did nothing, until the Mad Doctor declared, "The Marsh is damp and miserable. Please, my dear Mites, come inside with me and we can make you something more fun to dance with from this Myrtlewood in the morning.". The Mites (both in and out of their Myrtlewood masks) drummed against the ground and danced around each other, until they decided they would join the Mad Doctor, and they all made their way inside.

The next day as the morning sun dawned, the Mad Doctor awoke, convinced this had all been a maniacal dream, and that the Mites, the Mote, the Myrtlewood, and even his mug full of mud and mint had merely been another delusion. He rubbed the dust from his eyes and the corners of his mouth, put on his monocle and dropped his feet off the side of his bed, ready to get back to work making the many machines he had designed at his desk. Just before his dirty feet (mud from the marsh had dried on them) touched the floor, he saw a glimmer on his mantle reflected in the mirror from just outside metal edge of his monoce.

The Mad Doctor moved his head to look at the mirror, but detected no Mite on his mantle. Discouraged, he looked down at the mildly dusty floor, where to his surprise he saw there were millions of shreds of the massive Myrtlewood scattered around his room. Right as he noticed them there, the little Mites began to glow and pulse merrily until The Mad Doctor had to look away. The Mites spread away from him, clearing a path to his making-table in the main room of The Mad Doctor's workshop.

The Mad Doctor moseyed into the main room, where he saw mountains of Mites on the making-table by his Myrtlewood making-mallet. The Mites hummed a mirthful sort of monotone music, divided into multiple mounds of both differing design and disposition. The Mad Doctor declined into his making-chair, and to his delight, the Mites moved his mallet towards him, leaving a mildly muddy trail along their drive. The Mites were moist and therefore mostly malleable, he determined. The Mad Doctor mused that the Mites seemed like they desired to be more, and that they might need his help to do so. He took his making-mallet into his hands and realized some of the Mites' magic had migrated into it.

The Mad Doctor looked back at his making-table, and saw that several Mites were making themselves into the model of a miniature arm. As he leaned over to delve into this miraculous development, he noticed that his making-mallet started to glow more brightly. When he moved the mallet next to the miniature arm and the glow grew detectably more mighty, which made the Mad Doctor still more disquisitive. Perhaps even more mysterious, the arm Mites' music grew even more merry.

The Mad Doctor suddenly knew what the Mites wanted (or so he had determined), and he swung the making-mallet down mightily on the arm Mites.

Ding!

The sound rang out through The Mad Doctor's workshop.

Instantly, the music went dead. Dismayed, The Mad Doctor drew back, mortified that he may have destroyed his new magical friends. He dropped the making-mallet and was mollified by the discovery that the model of an arm had formed into a tiny arm made of Myrtlewood. The Mites began to hum again, and more of them formed into the design of another arm.

Ding! The Mites formed into a torso. Ding! The arms fused together with the torso. Ding! Ding! A pair of legs, too. Ding! They attached themsleves to the upper body.

With each new appendage, the little doll began to glow even more.

The Mites formed the shape of a head. Ding! The Mad Doctor paused. What if these little Myrtlewood Mites meant him malice? But they did help him find his way home, didn't they?

His hands shaking, The Mad Doctor raised the magical making-mallet again. This might be dangerous, but he must know what the little doll would do.

Ding!

The Mad Doctor moved the making-mallet closer to him defensively, and monitored the newly-minted doll.

The doll stood up in the manner of a man. The Mad Doctor asked the doll in a mousy voice, "Who are you, mysterious little doll? What do you want from me, my little Manikin?".

The Manikin pointed at the making-mallet, mutely turning it's head to face The Mad Doctor. The Mites on the making-table moved into the design of more models, and the Manikin motioned to each of them definitively in turn, all the while meeting the gaze of The Mad Doctor.

## Mites, Manikins, Memories, and Mobs

MEGADocker uses 4 fundamental building blocks:

> **_Mobs_**: an armada of manikins running around doing your bidding
>
> -- which are composed of
>
> > **_Manikins_**: little wooden dolls that want do your bidding
> >
> > -- which, in turn, are composed of
> >
> > > **_Mites_**: magical doodads that bring a manikin to life to do your bidding
> > >
> > > _and_
> > >
> > > **_Memories_**: how a manikin remembers what your bidding is.

You'll use MEGADocker to make your **Mob** of **Manikins**. MEGADocker manages the **Mites**, and tells you what **Memories** you **Mob** mandates, and where you might find that information. Then you just tell your **Mob** their **Memories** and make them march out to do your magnificent bidding.

You can also make your own **Mites** and mold them into all manner of **Manikins** to make your **Mobs** mightier.

[TOC](#table-of-contents 'Jump back to the Table of Contents')

[](#mites)

## Mites

**Mites** represent snippets of plain text (in the form of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) objects that conform to the `IMite` interface) that contain part of a **Manikin**'s file. This is almost always a snippet of [YAML](https://yaml.org) used to create a **Manikin** in a `pod.yml` or `docker-compose.yml` file, although a **Mite** can contain any kind of snippet necessary to make a configuration file for any application you can think of.

[TOC](#table-of-contents 'Jump back to the Table of Contents')

[](#memories)

## Memories

**Memories** represent the choices a user needs to make to configure a **Mob**. **Memories** can contain any kind of data, and their values will modify the output of one or more **Mites** in your **Mob**. For instance, if your **Manikin** needs to know where a volume is on your host to save data, when you add that Manikin to your **Mob**, the _Memories Table_ will add a row to request the location of that folder. If another **Manikin** also needs access to that **Memory**, it will automatically have that information.

[TOC](#table-of-contents 'Jump back to the Table of Contents')

[](#manikins)

### Manikins

**Manikins** represent a given microservice running in your [Docker](https://www.docker.com) swarm or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster.

[TOC](#table-of-contents 'Jump back to the Table of Contents')

[](#core-manikins)

#### Core Manikins

MEGADocker **Mobs** require a minimal core of **Manikins** to run services that are necessary for the **Mob** to function. When you generate a new **Mob**, these **Manikins** will already be in it, and their **Memories** will be in the _Memories Table_ waiting for you to populate them.

[TOC](#table-of-contents 'Jump back to the Table of Contents')

[](#included-manikins)

#### Included Manikins

MEGADocker includes Manikins for a number of common uses, and we add more all the time. These **Manikins** are optional, strictly speaking, but you'll probably want a few to do something useful for you.

[TOC](#table-of-contents 'Jump back to the Table of Contents')

[](#custom-manikins)

#### Custom Manikins

While MEGADocker includes many **Manikins**, we can't do everythingâ¦ yet. If you find that we are missing that one **Manikin** you need, you can write it yourself and build a custom version of MEGADocker for yourself. Of course, we'd love it if you added those **Manikins** to [this repo](https://github.com/VirtualEstatePlanner/MD), but you don't have to. Because MEGADocker is open source, you can look at any of the source code for existing **Manikins** and **Mites** to see how we do it.

[TOC](#table-of-contents 'Jump back to the Table of Contents')

[](#mobs)

### Mobs

**Mobs** represent a full stack of microservices (**Manikins**) deployed across a cluster or swarm of hosts. **Mobs** are saved as `.megadocker` files, and can also be exported as a `pod.yaml` or `docker-compose.yml` file to be used in Kubernetes or Docker swarm mode.
