## Mites, Manikins, Memories, and Mobs

MEGADocker uses 4 fundamental building blocks:

**_Mobs_**: an armada of manikins running around doing your bidding, which are composed of **_Manikins_**: little wooden dolls that want do your bidding, which are composed of: **_Mites_**: magical doodads that bring a manikin to life to do your bidding, and **_Memories_**: how a manikin remembers what your bidding is.

You'll use MEGADocker to create your Mob of Manikins. We'll handle the Mites, and tell you what Memories they need. Then you give them their Memories and tell them to March out and do your bidding.

You can also write your own Mites and use them to make custom Manikins and add them to your Mobs.

[](#mites)

## Mites

**Mites** represent snippets of text files (represented as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) objects, usually of type `ServiceMite` or `NetworkMite`, both of which inherit from type `Mite`) that contain part of a **Manikin**. This is almost always a snippet of [YAML](https://yaml.org) (we prefer the .yml extension) used to create a **Manikin** in a `docker-compose.yml` file, although a **Mite** can contain any kind of snippet necessary to make a configuration file for any application you can think of.

[](#memories)

## Memories

**Memories** represent the choices a user needs to make to configure a **Mob**. **Memories** can contain any kind of data, and their values will modify the output of a **Mite** (or of multiple **Mites**) in your **Mob**. For instance, if your **Manikin** needs to know where a volume is on your host to save data, when you add that Manikin to your **Mob**, the **Memories** table will add a row to request the location of that folder. If another **Manikin** also needs access to that **Memory\*\***, it will automatically have that information.

### Manikins

**Manikins** represent a given microservice running in your [Docker](https://www.docker.com) swarm or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster.
